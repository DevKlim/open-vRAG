00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.190
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Well, indeed, 197 subpoenas on 430 individuals and

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.590
groups.

3
00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:08.790
And what we do know is there were

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.690
nine senators.

5
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.470
I was one of the nine, as you

6
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.810
said.

7
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.230
And it appears that Judge James Boasberg, an

8
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.110
Obama appointee, a leftist, signed the subpoenas for

9
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.750
our phone records from January of 21.

10
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.650
Now, AT&T did not comply with that.

11
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.810
They challenged it and saw it as a

12
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.470
violation of the speech and debate clause.

13
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.930
Verizon, my carrier, did not move to quash

14
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.410
or challenge it.

15
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.710
And so they complied.

16
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.090
It was every phone call that was made

17
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.030
or received where I physically stood when I

18
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.730
received the call and then who the call

19
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.850
was either made to or from.

20
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.150
So very invasive.

21
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.050
It truly is a violation of the First

22
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.510
and Fourth Amendment rights.

23
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.750
It is a violation of the separation of

24
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.910
powers, the speech and debate, and the Stored

25
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.190
Communications Act.

26
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.870
And the kicker on all of this is

27
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.910
that Judge Boasberg put a nondisclosure order on

28
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.750
top of the subpoena, saying that the carrier

29
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.350
could not inform us of what had been

30
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.890
subpoenaed and then also stating the reason for

31
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.630
not disclosing was fearful of flight risk or

32
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.450
intimidating witnesses or destroying or tampering with evidence,

33
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.470
which all of this is absurd and ridiculous.

34
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.410
And it just shows you how deeply weaponized

35
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.210
the FBI and the DOJ was under Joe

36
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.430
Biden because April 4th of 22, Chris Wray

37
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.150
wrote a memo to Merrick Garland.

38
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.410
Lisa Monaco said sign off on this thing.

39
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.910
And on April 5th, Merrick Garland signed off

40
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.810
on the memo to establish Arctic Frost.

41
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.110
And the nebulous, vague language in that memo

42
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.870
is something everybody should read.

43
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.650
And it should really cause you to say,

44
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.610
OK, if they did this to nine sitting

45
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.170
U.S. senators, what are they doing to

46
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.810
every conservative in this country?
