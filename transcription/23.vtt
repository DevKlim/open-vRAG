00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.610
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) 32 million votes in 48 hours and no

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:02.930
internet.

3
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:04.890
That sounds impossible, right?

4
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.050
In Tanzania's 2025 election, officials announced that nearly

5
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.010
32 million votes were counted in under two

6
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:12.350
days.

7
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.310
Even as internet access was restricted, electricity was

8
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.350
unstable and observers struggled to verify results.

9
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.750
President Samir Sululu Hassan was declared the winner

10
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.170
with more than 97% of the vote,

11
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.930
a figure that raised as many eyebrows as

12
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.810
it did questions.

13
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.090
Across the border, countries like Kenya often take

14
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.510
days, sometimes weeks to finalise results, even with

15
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.070
full digital systems and media scrutiny.

16
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.050
Some call Tanzania's count efficiency, others call it

17
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.490
control.

18
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.750
But it made me wonder, how transparent is

19
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.090
a vote when the world can't see it?

20
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.870
Because this isn't just about Tanzania, it's about

21
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.610
trust.

22
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.830
When we talk about democracy in Africa, the

23
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.910
question isn't how fast votes are counted, it's

24
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.330
how credible the process really is.

25
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.850
If you've ever wondered how democracy looks when

26
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.450
the lights go off, this story will stay

27
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.930
with you.

28
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.890
This is the Africa you're not shown, but

29
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.730
I'm here to show you.
