00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.800
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Waterforce staff on the front line of our

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.280
migrant crisis are going to lay down their

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:05.800
tools.

4
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.900
My goodness, more than a hundred maritime officers,

5
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.460
the crews who patrol the Channel, well they're

6
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.900
going to go on strike on November the

7
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.580
14th.

8
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.400
Major blow for the Prime Minister of course

9
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.100
because he's already so much under fire for

10
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.840
failing to get a grip on small boat

11
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.480
crossings.

12
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.980
The Channel crossings, those illegal ones, up 25

13
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.520
% on this time last year.

14
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.720
So the Union, which represents Border Force staff,

15
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.920
PCS, say that staff will be striking because

16
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.860
of frozen allowances and working conditions.

17
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.700
Yeah, the Home Office says it has robust

18
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.080
plans to minimise disruption and uphold UK border

19
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.420
security, insisting those plans remain unchanged.

20
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.220
Wouldn't you think that one of the things

21
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.640
that, you know, one of the professions that

22
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.320
should not be allowed to strike would be

23
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.840
Border Force?

24
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.040
Well, maybe, but they are under a lot

25
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.380
of pressure, I don't blame them for being

26
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.940
fed up.

27
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.220
Let's get the take of the political editor

28
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.640
for Times Radio, Anna Mihailova.

29
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.239
Very good morning to you, Anna.

30
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.120
This is astonishing actually that Border Force can

31
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.160
go on strike at all when we need

32
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.900
them most.

33
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.960
Well, and you raise a good point about

34
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.480
professions that perhaps shouldn't strike.

35
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.480
And Temi Bainog, if you remember in her

36
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.180
recent conference, said she would ban GPs from

37
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.620
striking.

38
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.480
So I think the follow-up question to

39
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.180
that would be, would she also ban Border

40
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.480
Force?

41
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.520
And would other parties ban Border Force?

42
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.240
So I think that might be where the

43
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.820
debate moves after this, because it is pretty

44
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.240
shocking with the state of what is going

45
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.540
on with the small boats crisis that Border

46
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.520
Force would be allowed to strike.

47
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.720
Just to give some context on the story,

48
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.580
though, this appears to be something that is

49
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.600
part of long-running discussions with the Home

50
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.040
Office.

51
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.900
The Home Office had promised to standardise hours

52
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.500
for those staff, because obviously they do work

53
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.940
very unusual hours and are required to.

54
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.380
And this is something that the Home Office

55
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.820
said promised to do six years ago, started

56
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.620
talks on this six years ago, and hasn't

57
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.200
really delivered.

58
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.880
So that is why the union says that

59
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.320
it is taking action on that.

60
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.759
So there are questions for the Home Office

61
00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.840
here too, very much.

62
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.940
Yeah, but I mean, on the broader picture

63
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.420
of this, I mean, what a nightmare for

64
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.220
the Prime Minister.

65
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.260
Despite everything he promised, the numbers are going

66
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.700
up.

67
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.700
I know deportations are increasing as well, but

68
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.840
I mean, the number of people trying to

69
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.600
get here is up 25% year on

70
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.940
year.

71
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.700
And yet here we are, now his own

72
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.820
Border Force are throwing the towel in.

73
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.200
Yeah, and of course, it's not only a

74
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.940
problem for the Prime Minister, but also the

75
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.420
new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, who is well

76
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.020
respected and so far has been more proactive.

77
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.460
She has made a point of saying that

78
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.560
she will do whatever it takes to stop

79
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.240
both illegal and curb legal migration.

80
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.120
But this is an exact example of what

81
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.020
she is up against.

82
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.100
There are so many things that could go

83
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.580
wrong with the Home Office and in the

84
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.140
Home Office.

85
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.280
And this is one of the latest ones.

86
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.680
But of course, when you look at unions

87
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.040
striking, you have to understand that a year

88
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.940
ago, when Labour came in to government, one

89
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.040
of the first things Keir Starmer did was

90
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.100
give very generous settlements to a couple of

91
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.140
major unions, which of course does send a

92
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.240
signal to other unions about what they can

93
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.640
do too.
