00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.500
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) I think it's over the top at times

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.840
as well, at that point.

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.500
But listen, that's because we live in a

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.680
world where there are so many platforms, so

5
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.720
many people can say stuff and we'll be

6
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.400
picked up and made bigger than what else.

7
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.160
But I think it's good that, especially ex

8
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.660
-players that play at the highest level, played

9
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.580
at the top, that dealt with difficult moments

10
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.060
as well, to put also a lot of

11
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.040
things in perspective, I think.

12
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.220
I'm not saying it, no more.

13
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.420
I think I've sped them on.

14
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.700
I think we've put them on a winning

15
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.000
streak.

16
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.000
No, I think when you win the Premier

17
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.800
League, and I think what I've said, it

18
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.700
was fair when you win the Premier League,

19
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.980
and then you go on a run where

20
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.320
you lose three or four games in a

21
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.320
row, which you don't expect from Liverpool over

22
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.400
the last few years, and then as Virgil,

23
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.980
as you as the captain, I think that's

24
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.360
your opportunity then to go and lead the

25
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.640
players.

26
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.480
That's what I'm saying.

27
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.580
I think that happens in football, and I

28
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.100
think the response has been great from Virgil,

29
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.640
from the team.

30
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.420
I think if you would watch games, then

31
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.540
I would definitely take the responsibility.

32
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.740
I think the comment that I signed my

33
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.640
new deal, and then it's like, that's it,

34
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.220
let it slide, I think that was a

35
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.360
bit.

36
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.980
But that's my personal opinion.

37
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.000
Do you use things like that?

38
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.540
Does that fire you up?

39
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.040
I want to perform for the team, for

40
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.860
the club, for each and every one that

41
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.200
will support us through thick and thin.

42
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.060
When we go through a tough time as

43
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.860
a team, when we're losing games, obviously I'm

44
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.860
fortunate that didn't happen too many times, and

45
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.640
it hurts me so much, and I want

46
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.300
to turn this around.

47
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.360
Because I also see the hard work we

48
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.260
put in each and every day.

49
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.620
I see the quality that we have.
