(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) How are you going to get people to

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.510
stop being trans?

3
00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.110
I think we're going to tell boys that

4
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.150
they're not girls.

5
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.350
So we're going to tell boys that they're

6
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.550
not girls, and they're going to listen.

7
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:08.410
Yeah, basically.

8
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.050
Yeah, that's what we've done for most of

9
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:11.190
history.

10
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.690
Because that happened to me, and I can

11
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.390
promise you to God that I didn't listen.

12
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.410
Yeah, well, because we live at a time

13
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.410
that is affirming the transgender delusion.

14
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.830
But if we lived at a more sensible

15
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.590
time, probably you would have listened.

16
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.850
And I think we should just return to

17
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.990
a more sensible kind of politics.

18
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.450
You're not giving a solution on how you

19
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.590
would even be capable of doing something like

20
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.690
that.

21
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:29.970
We kicked the fellas out of the boys'

22
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.430
bathroom.

23
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.090
We kicked the transgender teaching out of schools.

24
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.430
We just enforced the law as it was

25
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.130
before 2015.

26
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.050
There was a law prohibiting trans women to

27
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.630
go into the women's bathroom, or trans men

28
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.750
going into the men's bathroom.

29
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.190
Yeah, it's there in the term women's bathroom.

30
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.810
That's why men can't go.

31
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.670
Yes, there are all sorts of laws against

32
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.470
public indecency, for one, against men going into

33
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.270
women's sports leagues.

34
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.650
There are all sorts of regulations against that,

35
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.810
or at least there were until recently.

36
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.290
We did not have, established in public life,

37
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.470
transgenderism until very, very recently.

38
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.190
That's not true.

39
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.230
That is true.

40
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.530
What about the two-spirited people?

41
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.610
What is the two-spirited people?

42
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.550
In the indigenous community, they are...

43
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.690
I don't want to get into semantics, but

44
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.090
I'm just...

45
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.190
I know that there has...

46
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.970
The fact is that there has always been

47
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:14.530
trans people.

48
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.290
Do you know where the phrase two-spirited

49
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.790
came from?

50
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.510
I don't.

51
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.510
Please enlighten me.

52
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.070
It came from the third annual inter-tribal

53
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.790
Native American First Nations Gay and Lesbian Americans

54
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.950
Conference in 1990.

55
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.110
And the woman who coined that term...

56
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.310
I just don't think that that's true.

57
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.590
It's true.

58
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.170
The woman who coined that term admitted...

59
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.630
Hold on.

60
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.910
Let me just finish my point on this.

61
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.510
The woman who coined that term, Maya Laramie,

62
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.710
admitted somewhat recently that the term two-spirit

63
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.410
came to her in a dream in 1990.

64
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.230
Now, the Ojibwe Nation actually has translated this

65
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.430
term.

66
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.910
I just don't...

67
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.470
It's the Nijmani Duwag.

68
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.890
But they translated it from the English in

69
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.330
1990.

70
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.610
How you're capable of eradicating an entire percentage

71
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.490
of people by setting laws?

72
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.930
Because people are so...

73
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.170
You're not...

74
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.050
I think you're choosing not to hear what

75
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.510
I'm saying.

76
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.170
Because I'm saying we don't want to eradicate

77
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.590
any people.

78
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.970
We want to eradicate...

79
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.110
Isn't the word eradicate in the past?

80
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.250
But the other word is transgenderism, which is

81
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.530
an ideology, not a group of people.

82
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.169
But I am a transgender person.

83
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.910
You can't just skip over that fact.

84
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.050
You are a confused person, but you're not...

85
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.290
I'm not, babe.

86
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.150
I'm so secure in myself.

87
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.210
And there's other women in this room that

88
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.710
are also trans, have been trans for 20

89
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.010
plus years, seven years, babe, that know exactly

90
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.650
what they're doing.

91
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.110
You're confused because it's not possible for a

92
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.910
man to become a woman.

93
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.250
How are you capable of looking at somebody

94
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.690
without knowing their bodily autonomy, knowing anything that's

95
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.830
going on with their medical history?

96
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.070
Your bodily autonomy?

97
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.350
Anything.

98
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.630
Because I know the basics of human nature.

99
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.010
You know nothing about me.

100
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.870
I know that you're human.

101
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.730
And I know a little bit about human

102
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.990
nature.

103
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.090
And I know that a boy can't become

104
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.370
a girl.

105
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.990
So that's what I know.

106
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.030
Does anybody want to take that?
