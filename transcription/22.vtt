(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Much as he can be a friend.

2
00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:01.970
He's a tough man.

3
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.350
He's a tough man.

4
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:04.870
Smart man, actually.

5
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.690
Very smart.

6
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.790
The press doesn't like it when I call

7
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:08.770
him very smart, you know.

8
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.270
They think I'm not supposed to call him

9
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.190
smart, but at least 1.4 billion people

10
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:14.770
without question.

11
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.990
In fact, during the meeting we were there,

12
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.470
a couple of you were there, and some

13
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.270
of you saw it.

14
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.530
So he's here, and he's got about six

15
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.850
people on each side, and every one of

16
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.750
those people was standing like this.

17
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.550
They weren't attached.

18
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.790
And I made a comment to one of

19
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.190
them, and he got no response.

20
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.810
I said, are you going to answer me?

21
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.770
I got no response.

22
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.750
And President Xi didn't let him have any.

23
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.450
So, if there's any question, I said, I

24
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.210
want my cabinet to behave like that.

25
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.050
I'm demanding that my cabinet, I want them

26
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.030
sitting up like that, Tim, just nice and

27
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.290
straight.

28
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.690
I've never seen posture like that.

29
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.430
I've never seen men so scared in their

30
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.770
lives.

31
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.450
They have the equivalent of a vice president.

32
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.830
I said, are you going to answer my

33
00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:58.350
question?

34
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.290
And he's like, he doesn't move.

35
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.490
I said, what's wrong with this guy?

36
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.970
Oh, I will answer all questions.

37
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.990
Why don't you behave like that?

38
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.050
J.D. doesn't behave like that.

39
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.970
J.D. buds into conversations.

40
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.590
I want to have that for at least

41
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.670
a couple of days, okay, J.D.? We'll

42
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.930
keep you long-term, but a couple of

43
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.190
days.

44
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.710
A couple of days of that would be

45
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.410
very, very nice.

46
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.210
Okay, I want to thank you, and we'll

47
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.370
talk.
