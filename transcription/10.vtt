00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.710
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) In the first place, the role of the

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.110
Church is to preach the Gospel.

3
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.310
And just a couple of days ago we

4
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.190
heard Matthew's Gospel, chapter 25, which says, Jesus

5
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.830
says very clearly, at the end of the

6
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.310
world, we're going to be asked, you know,

7
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.730
how did you receive the foreigner?

8
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.410
Did you receive him and welcome him or

9
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.770
not?

10
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.230
And I think that there's a deep reflection

11
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.670
that needs to be made in terms of

12
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.270
what's happening.

13
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.430
And many people who've lived for years and

14
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.730
years and years, never causing problems, have been

15
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.570
deeply affected by what's going on right now.

16
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.850
The spiritual rights of people who have been

17
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.810
detained should also be considered.

18
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.730
And I would certainly invite the authorities to

19
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.750
allow pastoral workers to attend to the needs

20
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.690
of those people.

21
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.130
Many times they've been separated from their families

22
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.210
for a good amount of time.

23
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.350
No one knows what's happening.

24
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.650
But their own spiritual needs should be attended

25
00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.930
to.
