00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.120
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Or you need an ID for everything else,

2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.880
including just recently to prove that you were

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.400
vaccinated.

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.260
The same people who are demanding that you

5
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.700
have a vaccine passport are the same ones

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.480
saying you need no ID to vote.

7
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.540
Same people.

8
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.140
Right, but like...

9
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.960
So it's obviously hypocritical and inconsistent.

10
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.340
So you really think it's just to get

11
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.920
more voters?

12
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.700
If you want to understand behavior, you have

13
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.620
to look at the incentives.

14
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.060
So once the Democratic Party in the US

15
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.080
and the left in Europe realized that if

16
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.540
you have open borders and you provide a

17
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.000
ton of government handouts, which creates a massive

18
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.540
financial incentive for people from other countries to

19
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.660
come to your country, and you don't prosecute

20
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.640
them for crime, they're going to be beholden

21
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.600
to you, and they will vote for you.
