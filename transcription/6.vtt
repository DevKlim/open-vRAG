(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Zoran Kwame Mamdani, the youngest and first Muslim

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.770
mayor of New York City is trending across

3
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.530
social media.

4
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.970
Yes, absolutely, he deserves to be celebrated for

5
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.510
what he stands for and the politics that

6
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.010
he speaks.

7
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.450
While we celebrate, I think it's time we

8
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.650
ask some tough questions here in India as

9
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.810
well.

10
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.590
Why are mayor elections facing constant delays?

11
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.650
Why do only eight states in our country

12
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.970
allow people to directly elect their mayors?

13
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.510
In my own state, Tamil Nadu, why did

14
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.750
we move from direct to indirect elections?

15
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.230
Local government elections are not minor.

16
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.490
They decide how our cities function, how our

17
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.990
streets, water and public spaces are managed.

18
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.770
They are equally as important as state and

19
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.670
national elections because the real democracy begins at

20
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.590
the grassroots in our own neighborhoods.

21
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.270
I think it's time to remind our governments,

22
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.110
remind ourselves that we the people still hold

23
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.510
the power.

24
00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.870
Let's value our local governments.

25
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.230
Let's demand accountability where democracy starts.
