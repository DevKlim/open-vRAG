00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.019
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) We will refuse to allow those who traffic

2
00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:06.440
in division and hate to pit us against

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.920
one another.

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.060
In this moment of political darkness, New York

5
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.040
will be the light.

6
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.280
We believe in standing up for those we

7
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.760
love.

8
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.800
Whether you are an immigrant, a member of

9
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.080
the trans community, one of the many black

10
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.140
women that Donald Trump has fired from a

11
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.920
federal job, a single mom still waiting for

12
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.020
the cost of groceries to go down, or

13
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.980
anyone else with their back against the wall,

14
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.680
your struggle is ours too.

15
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.920
And we will build a city hall that

16
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.040
stands steadfast alongside Jewish New Yorkers and does

17
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.940
not waver in the fight against the scourge

18
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.920
of anti-Semitism.

19
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.980
Indian Muslims know that they belong.

20
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.200
Not just in the five boroughs of this

21
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.340
city, but in the halls of power.

22
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.800
No more will New York be a city

23
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.060
where you can traffic in Islamophobia and win

24
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.580
an election.

25
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.550
This new age will be defined by a

26
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.870
competence and a compassion that have too long

27
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.750
been placed at odds with one another.

28
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.770
We will prove that there is no problem

29
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.530
too large for government to solve and no

30
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.250
concern too small for it to care about.

31
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.810
For years, those in city hall have only

32
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.910
helped those who can help them.

33
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.990
But on January 1st, we will usher in

34
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.630
a city government that helps everyone.

35
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.210
Now I know that many have heard our

36
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.430
message only through the prism of misinformation.

37
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.290
Tens of millions of dollars have been spent

38
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.010
to redefine reality and to convince our neighbors

39
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.650
that this new age is something that should

40
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.370
frighten them.

41
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.070
As has so often occurred, the billionaire class

42
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.170
has sought to convince those making $30 an

43
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.910
hour that their enemies are those earning $20

44
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.690
an hour.

45
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.450
We fight amongst ourselves so that we remain

46
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.530
distracted from the work of remaking a long

47
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.470
broken system.

48
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.750
We refuse to let them dictate the rules

49
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.970
of the game anymore.

50
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.890
They can play by the same rules as

51
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:04.950
the rest of us.

52
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.770
Together, we will usher in a generation of

53
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:12.330
change.

54
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.110
And if we embrace this brave new course,

55
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.550
rather than fleeing from it, we can respond

56
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.390
to oligarchy and authoritarianism with the strength it

57
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.710
fears, not the appeasement it craves.

58
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:34.160
After all, if anyone can show a nation

59
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.140
betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him,

60
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.340
it is the city that gave rise to

61
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.620
him.

62
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:48.400
The only way to terrify a despot is

63
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.760
by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him

64
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.020
to accumulate power.

65
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.920
It's how we stop the next one.

66
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.270
So Donald Trump, since I know you're watching,

67
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.959
I urge for you, turn the volume up!
