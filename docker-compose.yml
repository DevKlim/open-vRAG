      # --- IMPORTANT FOR PERFORMANCE & PERSISTENCE ---
      # The following volumes are crucial to avoid re-downloading large files (like models)
      # every time you restart the container. Make sure these local directories exist in your `vChat` folder.

      # Mount the current directory for live code changes in development
      - .:/app

      # Mount a local directory to cache Hugging Face models and other assets.
      # This prevents re-downloading multi-gigabyte models on every startup.
      # ON YOUR HOST: Create a directory named `huggingface_cache` in this folder.
      - ./huggingface_cache:/root/.cache/huggingface

      # Mount a local directory to store downloaded videos from the web UI.
      - ./videos:/app/videos

      # Mount a local directory for datasets used by fine-tuning scripts.
      - ./data:/app/data

      # OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED FOR STARTUP SPEED: Pre-download the model.
      # 1. Download the model from Hugging Face: `git lfs install && git clone https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/VideoChat-R1_5`
      # 2. Place the downloaded `VideoChat-R1_5` folder into this project's `vChat` directory.
      # 3. Rename the folder from `VideoChat-R1_5` to `VideoChat-R1` to match the path below.
      # The application will then load the model directly from this folder instead of downloading it.
      - ./VideoChat-R1:/app/local_model # <-- This local folder `VideoChat-R1` will be mapped inside the container.
