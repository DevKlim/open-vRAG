According to ICE, Renderos Leiva is an illegal immigrant from El Salvador who entered the U.S. in 2007 and was ordered removed in 2020. Officials say she was taken into custody during a targeted enforcement operation and is being held pending removal. The arrest, made by Homeland Security and Border Patrol agents acting on ICE’s behalf, happened near the airport’s baggage claim area. The Salt Lake City Council called the operation “unusual” and said it “creates fear and uncertainty in our community,” emphasizing it was not coordinated with city police. The council says it’s seeking more information from federal authorities. Mayor Erin Mendenhall also condemned the incident, saying she reviewed footage of plain-clothed agents detaining the woman in a public area of the terminal. “Nothing about this incident, like so many ICE operations, makes me feel safer as an American,” she said. Both the mayor and city council reiterated that the Salt Lake City Police Department had no role in the operation and is prohibited by federal law from interfering with immigration enforcement.

At #IUCNWCC last week, Resolution 007 towards a Soil Security Law was officially adopted — a historic step recognizing that healthy, living soil is the foundation of well-being for all Life on Earth. Initiated, sponsored, and tabled by SoilSAL, Save Soil, and GCELS, this #IUCNResolution 007 is now our collective call to action. We can’t safeguard our future without safeguarding the soil beneath our feet. From supporting biodiversity preservation to climate change mitigation and adaptation, and ensuring food, water, and energy security, soil is at the heart of our planet’s health — and now, it’s one stride closer to getting the legal protection it deserves. Why it matters: ● Global recognition for urgent, comprehensive, legal protection for soil  ● Jumpstarts multi-stakeholder collaboration to develop concepts and parameters for an international convention or a global legal instrument on soil security ● Aligns fragmented global mechanisms and promotes policy coherence across local, national, regional, and international governance levels to scale soil as a nexus solution for global existential challenges ● Recognizes Indigenous peoples’ roles in soil stewardship and sustainable agriculture to revitalize soil In the words of the late Dr. Jane Goodall: “We know what we must do, so Let’s Make It Happen!” @iucn_wcel
